# GitPrint.com
## Version 2! Now with less server

Ever found that printing README's or Markdown files from Github.com is a pain in the ass? Me too.

## The trick:

Simply view any markdown file on Github, then in your URL bar replace the github.com part of the URL with gitprint.com. Your markdown file will be rendered to a beautiful, printable, downloadable PDF.

## Where to find it:

gitprint.com
